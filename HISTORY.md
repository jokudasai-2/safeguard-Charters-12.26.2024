   - Better build performance
   - Modern features out of the box

2. **Supabase over Custom Backend**
   - Rapid development
   - Built-in authentication
   - Real-time capabilities
   - Row Level Security

3. **TailwindCSS over CSS-in-JS**
   - Better performance
   - Easier maintenance
   - Consistent styling
   - Smaller bundle size

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Feature-based Structure**
   - Better organization
   - Clear boundaries
   - Easier maintenance
   - Scalable architecture

2. **Custom Hooks Pattern**
   - Reusable logic
   - Better testing
   - Cleaner components
   - Separation of concerns

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Better user experience
   - Immediate feedback
   - Reduced server load
   - Optimistic updates

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex State Management
- **Problem**: Managing complex state across features
